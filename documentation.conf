Forces file updates to be written to disk. When you use [file:write](#filewrite)

This improves the performance of the file output commands. Closing a file
ensures that all output is written to disk.

This command will interpret *string* as a path name to a file and open the file.

and [file:read-characters](#fileread-characters) to read in from the file, or
[file:write](#filewrite), [file:print](#fileprint), [file:type](#filetype), or
[file:show](#fileshow) to write out to the file.

Note that you can only open a file for reading or writing but not both. The next
file i/o primitive you use after this command dictates which mode the file is
opened in. To switch modes, you need to close the file using [file:close](#fileclose).

Also, the file must already exist if opening a file in reading mode.

When opening a file in writing mode, all new data will be appended to the end of
the original file. If there is no original file, a new blank file will be
created in its place. (You must have write permission in the file's directory.)
(If you don't want to append, but want to replace the file's existing contents,
use [file:delete](#filedelete) to delete it first, perhaps inside a carefully if you're not
sure whether it already exists.)

Note that *string* can either be a file name or an absolute file path. If it
is a file name, it looks in whatever the current directory is. This can be
